This repository contains data on monthly average rainfall in Oxford and Melbourne from 1855-2015. The code combines the two separate datasets on rainfall into a single dataset and plots the monthly average rainfall data for both locations together in a simple line graph.

To run this analysis use the following commands:

Rscript output/combine-data.R

Rscript output/make-plot.R
  
The input data are in the "data" file and the resulting tables and graphs on rainfall patterns are in the "output" file.
