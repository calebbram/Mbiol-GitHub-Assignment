This repository contains code to combine data on monthly average rainfall (1855-2015) in Oxford and Melbourne into a single dataset.

To run this analysis use the following commands:
  Rscript output/combine-data.R
  Rscript output/make-plot.R
  
The input data are in the "data" file and the resulting tables and graphs on rainfall patterns are in the "output" file.
